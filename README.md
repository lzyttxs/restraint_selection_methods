# restraint selection methods

We provide the codes for implementing the five restraint selection methods described in the paper 'Identifying the minimal sets of distance restraints for FRET-assisted protein structural modeling' (arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07983). 

Three of the restraint selection methods, random selection, normal mode analysis, and the largest CÎ± separation method, do not use information about the target structure. Two additional methods, the largest change in pairwise separation method and linear discriminant analysis, compare the initial and target structure toidentify the most effective restraints.
